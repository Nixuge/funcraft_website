2 regexes for the heads:
- https://web.archive.org/web/.*?/https://d31zb6ev5hmn3f.cloudfront.net/_u/avatar/head/(.*?)/s/.*?" (most heads)
- https://web.archive.org/web/.*?/https://d31zb6ev5hmn3f.cloudfront.net/_u/avatar/head/(.*?)/m/.*?' (your profile -> default head here)
No idea what's the diff between /s/ and /m/; using the same endpoint for now.
